    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Depression Era peanut butter bread is not too sweet, and was developed during the depression when eggs, oil, and butter were hard to come by. I have modernized it a bit by adding chopped peanuts and PB2 powdered peanut butter, but they are optional. The bread is equally delicious without them.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons powdered peanut butter, such as PB2Â® (optional)</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped peanuts (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, peanut butter powder, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix peanut butter, milk, and brown sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer until fully combined. Add flour mixture and mix on low speed just until flour disappears; stir in peanuts. Scoop batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth out with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, remove from the pan, then cool completely on the wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
