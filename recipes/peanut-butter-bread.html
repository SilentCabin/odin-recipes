    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Depression Era peanut butter bread is not too sweet, and was developed during the depression when eggs, oil, and butter were hard to come by. I have modernized it a bit by adding chopped peanuts and PB2 powdered peanut butter, but they are optional. The bread is equally delicious without them.</p>
