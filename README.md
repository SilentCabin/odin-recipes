# odin-recipes
This is a Recipes project 
//Insert what skills I have demonstrated once ive completed
I added headings, unordered lists, ordered lists, images and links. 
I made the first recipe page and also created an emmet code to make the next pages quicker to build.
Emmet Code : h1+img+p+ul>li*10^h2+ol>li*5

The main skills I learned were using git.
I have tried to use conventional commits so hopefully its something I can improve on.
